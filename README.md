## üìÅ Contents

### Exercises
Each exercise builds progressively, helping to develop proficiency in digital design using Verilog and ModelSim.

1. **Exercise 1 - Verilog and ModelSim Basics**  
   Introduces the fundamentals of Verilog and ModelSim, focusing on syntax, simulation, and basic design verification.

2. **Exercise 2 - Design Structures**  
   Explores various design structures, including hierarchical and modular designs, to build complex digital systems effectively.

3. **Exercise 3 - Memory and Delays**  
   Delves into memory architecture and timing delays, emphasizing how these affect overall system performance and accuracy.

4. **Exercise 4 - Datapath and Controller Design**  
   Involves designing a simple datapath and controller, consolidating previous concepts in a comprehensive design exercise.

### Midterm Exam - Take-Home Assignment
The take-home midterm consisted of eight topics, of which I chose two to implement:

- **Elevator Control System**: Designed a digital system to manage the movement, floor selection, and safety features of an elevator.
- **Daily Parking Control System**: Developed a system to handle entry, exit, and tracking for a daily parking facility, with real-time status and capacity management.

### Final Project - Vector Processor
For the course project, I designed and implemented a **vector processor**. This processor is built to handle vector operations efficiently and demonstrates advanced digital design concepts, including parallelism and optimized data handling.
